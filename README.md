# EV Route Planner

EV Route Planner is a web application designed to help electric vehicle (EV) users plan optimal routes that include necessary stops at charging stations. Given a departure location, destination, and the vehicle's full charge autonomy in kilometers, it calculates the best route with intermediate stops at charging stations. The application uses the OpenChargeMap API and OpenStreetMap API via the Leaflet library.
